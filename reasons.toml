[psychopath]
name = "psychopath"
rat = false
text = "The FBI consultants describe a five phase model of how a typical psychopath climbs to and maintains power. Many traits exhibited by these individuals include: superficial charm, insincerity, egocentricity, manipulativeness, grandiosity, lack of empathy, low agreeableness, exploitativeness, independence, rigidity, stubbornness and dictatorial tendencies. Babiak and Hare say for corporate psychopaths, success is defined as the best revenge and their problem behaviors are repeated \"ad infinitum\" due to little insight and their proto-emotions such as \"anger, frustration, and rage\" is refracted as irresistible charm. The authors note that lack of emotional literacy and moral conscience is often confused with toughness, the ability to make hard decisions, and effective crisis management. Babiak and Hare also emphasizes a reality they identified with psychopaths from studies that psychopaths are not able to be influenced by any sort of therapy."

I'm working insane amount of hours on it to abuse it as much as possible, I barely sleep and I've stopped going out with friends. My whole life is dedicated to this one thing to an extreme degree. I don't feel like I can stop. I have no weekends, no days off, nothing is as important as abusing this as much as possible. When I'm not working on it, I think about it, obsessively. There is nothing else on my mind. I am machine built to this one purpose. I'm constantly doubting myself and checking the math again and again, but every time I realize that I am indeed correct. I'm exhausted, excited, anxious and sleep deprived, and I don't see it changing any time soon."

I do not tolerate any type of cheating, nor do i support cheating. I used to have    a very good friend. We knew each other since kindergarden, and were really close friends. We both started to play skyblock in    a coop. We were a really great team and always had so much fun together. Forward a few years later, and i caught him using a    well-known cheat by the name \"Skytils\". I was fuming. I was ashamed. Obviously, there was only 1 thing i could do. I nuked the    coop and ended our friendship. I couldn't believe that my friend would do such a sin. Cheating was one of god's worst    creations, and cheating was an insanely big sin. I am religious so this was a very, very, very big deal. Nothing can make me    lose my respect for the almighty in the sky. I have tried everything to convince my friend to not use cheats, but instead of    listening to me, he installed more cheats, such as \"Not Enough Updates\" and \"SkyblockExtras\". My problem with    SkyblockExtras is that it's a paid cheater mod, which is the worst type of cheating mods, and i am completely ashamed of my    old friend to go out of their way to pay for a cheating mod. I fell into depression, knowing that all hopes for the skyblock    community were lost. I was dead inside. This happened about a few months ago, but i am still furious at this. This is exactly    why i don't want you guys to cheat. If you do not follow rule 7, i will ban you, report you on discord with my 1000 alts and try    to sue you for ruining everyone's fun. No one has any fun when cheating. So please, for the love of god, listen to rule 7, or else    i'm gonna have to take actions."

They mistakenly think that they are doing as well as \"average\" or even \"above average\". It is a psychological effect in which people don't realize their level of knowledge or ability in a subject. People who know little about a subject will think that they know more than they actually know. People of low ability may not have enough intelligence to fully grasp how complicated something can be, causing them to overestimate their knowledge or ability. This can cause them to underestimate the intelligence of a high ability person who claims something is complicated when they falsely believe they understand it fully."

research has indicated the presence of the plains rat in areas such as the Fowlers Gap and

Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May before fully releasing in November, with Notch stepping down and Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time. In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets. Minecraft received critical acclaim, winning several awards and later being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual Minecon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. Several spin-offs have also been made, including Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, Minecraft Earth, and Minecraft Legends."

Players will have to spend money on refuelling, toll costs in certain countries, and maintenance costs if damage is incurred. When starting out, players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what is known as quick jobs—these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start accepting better-paying jobs by using their own truck instead of being a driver for hire with equipment being provided."
